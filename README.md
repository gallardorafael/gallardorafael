### Hey ðŸ‘€

I'm Rafael. I'm a Applied Machine Learning Scientist, with a strong focus on computer vision, however, I really like to play with NLP (mostly language models).
I have over 5 years of experience working with AI, I started as a researcher in a laboratory, and now I am building things (as engineer) in startups. I have experience building products from scratch. A more in-depth resume is available on my [personal website](gallardorafael.github.io).

If you want to get in touch, here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gallardo-garcia-r/).
